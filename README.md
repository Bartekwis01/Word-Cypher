This is a simple tool that allows you to code and decode an (almost) unlimited length of text(the limitation is the amount of words in the words.txt file). It works by switching out one word for another and storing the dictionary([codebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codebook)) in a file. For example: "cat" can be coded into "dog" and "dog" can be then decoded back into "cat" with the dictionary:
"cat": "dog". This program currently preserves cases, punctuation marks and emojis.

This program has been made for educational purposes only. It is no way a viable solution to secure any important data. This program is suseptable to attacks such as [frequency analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_analysis). I recommend reading [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_(cryptography)) article on Wikipedia to learn more. TL;DR is that this program doesn't encrypt but rather codes text.
