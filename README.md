This is a simple tool that allows you to cypher and decypher an (almost) unlimited length of text(the limitation is the amount of words in the words.txt file). It works by switching out one word for another and storing the dictionary in a file. For example: "cat" can be encrypted into "dog" and "dog" can be then decrypted back into "cat" with the dictionary:
"cat": "dog". This program currently preserves cases, punctuation marks and emojis.
